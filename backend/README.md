# Welcome to the backend of News Manager
Within this REST API, I have skillfully implemented an authentication and authorization system, ensuring secure and accurate user access. Additionally, I've incorporated an automatic documentation generation feature, a testament to my commitment to enhancing both user experience and ease of ongoing system maintenance.

You can access the documentation generated with swagger in the following link:
- [Endpoint Documentation](http://localhost:10001)

# Types of users
The system has the following types of users:

Public Users:
- Can read the posts.
- Can find out the categories of the posts.

Administrators:
- Can manage the posts.
- Can manage the categories.
- Can manage the users.
- Can comment on the posts.

Regular Users:

For the subject of authentication you can use the following methods
